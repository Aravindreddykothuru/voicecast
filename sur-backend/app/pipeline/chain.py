"""Builds and kicks off the Celery chains -- called from
POST /api/projects/{id}/process and .../confirm-language.

Each link's return value (always the project_id) becomes the first positional
arg of the next, per Celery chain semantics; stage-specific extra args are
bound with .s(...).

The pipeline is deliberately split in two. Everything up to and including ASR
is cheap; everything after it is not (TTS runs minutes per sentence on CPU).
So when `review_language` is on, the run stops after transcribe and waits for
a human to confirm or correct the detected source language. A wrong
auto-detect that runs straight through produces a dub in the wrong language
and wastes the entire expensive half. See CONTRACTS.md #5.
