"""Celery application: one queue per pipeline stage.

Per the PRD: ASR/TTS/emotion/diarization need GPUs, extraction/muxing only
need CPU+ffmpeg, and translation is comparatively cheap. Routing each stage
to its own queue lets you run a small CPU worker fleet alongside a smaller,
expensive GPU fleet, and scale/retry them independently -- see
docker-compose.yml for how the `worker-cpu`, `worker-gpu`, and `worker-tts`
services split these queues across `-Q` flags. `q.synthesize` gets its own
service/image (Dockerfile.worker-tts) rather than sharing `worker-gpu`'s:
CosyVoice2 pins torch==2.3.1 against pyannote/transformers' torch==2.4.1,
and the two cannot coexist in one environment. See requirements-tts.txt and
CONTRACTS.md #1.
