"""The single source of truth for what this backend can actually do.

Why this exists: the frontend used to carry its own hand-written list of 12
target languages. The translation provider only had FLORES codes for 7 of
them, so picking Gujarati, Punjabi, Odia, Assamese or Urdu raised ValueError
deep in the translate stage and killed the whole job. Two lists, one of them
wrong, no test connecting them.

Nothing may hardcode a language list again. The frontend renders whatever
GET /api/capabilities returns; the translation provider derives its FLORES
mapping from here; a test asserts every entry is complete.
