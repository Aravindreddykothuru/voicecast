"""Boot-time verification that this deployment is actually usable.

CONTRACTS.md invariants #1 and #4. Each check is cheap and answers a question
that has silently been "no" in production before:

  * every provider configured as `real` can be constructed, and its model
    loads with a complete head (the emotion classifier ran on random weights
    for a whole release because nothing asked);
  * every gated provider has the credential it needs, named explicitly,
    rather than discovering a 401 midway through a customer's job;
  * every advertised language is complete.

Run by the Celery workers, which are the processes that actually own the
models. The API process calls verify_capabilities() only -- it holds no
models, and booting the API is how an operator would go and look at why the
workers are unhappy.
