"""The X-User-Email stub must not be an identity in production.

get_current_user layered a real bearer token over a dev convenience: with
no Authorization header it trusted X-User-Email, looked the address up, and
created the account if it was missing. Nothing gated that on environment,
so against a production deployment

    curl -H "X-User-Email: victim@example.com" https://host/api/projects

returned the victim's projects. HTTP 200, no token, no password. The
WebSocket route took the same address as a `user_email` query parameter,
so the ownership check added for it was answering "does this email own the
project" when the open question was "is the caller this email at all".

Verified against a real uvicorn process with ENVIRONMENT=production before
the fix (200 and an accepted socket) and after (401 and a 403 handshake).
These are the regression tests for it.
