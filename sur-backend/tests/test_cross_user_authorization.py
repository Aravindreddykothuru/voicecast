"""User A must not be able to reach user B's data through any entry point.

is_uuid answered "is this id well-formed". It never answered "does this
caller own this row". Those are different questions, and only the first one
had been asked -- the WebSocket route asked neither, so anyone who knew or
guessed a project id could stream that project's transcripts, detected
language and error messages.

Parametrized across every id-bearing route so a new one is covered by the
same table rather than by someone remembering to add a case.
