"""Test fixtures.

The suite runs against real Postgres, on purpose. SQLite does not enforce
column widths, foreign keys, NOT NULL on existing rows, unique constraints,
CHECK constraints, or transaction isolation the way Postgres does -- that
gap is exactly what let projects.status ship as VARCHAR(10) in production
(sized for "processing") while 137 SQLite-backed tests stayed green, until
a real project tried to write "awaiting_language_confirmation" (31 chars)
and Postgres rejected it. See CONTRACTS.md and the migration-drift test in
test_schema_matches_migrations.py.

There is no SQLite fallback here, and there must not be one added back:
TEST_DATABASE_URL is required with no default, and a sqlite:/// value is a
hard error. A silent fallback is how this exact gap reopens.

Everything else runs with no external services: Celery's eager mode
instead of a real Redis broker/worker, an in-memory storage double instead
of MinIO/S3, and mock providers (the default anyway) instead of any ML
model. Only the database itself needs to be the real thing.
